# Movies-Database-ETL (Extract Transform Load)
Design database based on the given movie data and create the database using mySQL. Create an ETL script using python based on the database which take on the .csv file and insert the data into the existing database.

## Overview of the Code
In this project, we construct the pipeline that extract the data from movies.csv. The final pipeline can be called by executing the extract_transform_load() function in [ETL_movie_database.ipynb](https://github.com/muyassarhafizh/Movies-Database-ETL/blob/main/ETL_movie_database.ipynb). Before builiding the ultimate pipeline, we need to construct the functions and procedures step by step. To do so, we need [ETL-test.ipynb](https://github.com/muyassarhafizh/Movies-Database-ETL/blob/main/ETL-test.ipynb) file which is also provided and can be used to figure out how the ETL process works.
